# Why ‘Island in the Sun’ Is Weezer’s Greatest Song

There’s a difference between something that is out and out brilliant and something that is simply serviceable for a purpose. Island in The Sun is the perfect tune, a summer bop, a scintillating score for the nature of everyday life. It perfectly underscores the feeling of longing that we have, the desire to reach a plane, a place free of pain, strife, and struggles. Yet, we often try to escape our tribulations, only to find it is in vain. It’s an exploration of an avenue, an idea, and it stretches it out and creates a world of its own. It exists in a vacuum, much like the song itself, and makes itself universal. This services to exemplify the reason why it has found such large commercial success. Make no question about its lyricism, its musicality, instrumentation, and everything that goes into making it a groundbreaking success in rock music—a revolution, a truly trailblazing effort that provides access into new avenues. The possibilities of the song’s usability are endless.

I may be biased in this regard because I listened to this song a lot as I was going through a psychosis and believed that I had died and gone to heaven. That line, “We’ll never feel bad anymore,” really resonated with me because I thought I actually was in heaven and wasn’t going to feel any more pain. Unfortunately, that wasn’t the truth, nor was it close to the meaning of the lyrics, which leads me to the next reason why this song is so good: the meaning behind it and its universality. The idea of “we’ll be playing and having fun”. We’ll do this, we’ll do that, it’s all in the future tense. None of it has happened and none of it is guaranteed to happen. It’s all what he wishes that happens, and although the melodic beat indicates that he is calm and placid, there’s something in the lyrics that carves something more out of it. That’s the endless nature of the song; there’s so much there to dig into.

Can’t you see it fitting perfectly in a scene about two listless individuals on a beach? It was used in multiple popular movies, The Wedding Planner and Aquamarine, to name a couple. This isn’t to say that some of their other work isn’t breathtakingly brilliant. Quite the contrary. The debate would be null and void if one looked at the pure exceptional ability of some of the songs in Blue Album and Pinkerton. Objectivity, however, wins the day.

Weezer is without a doubt a polarizing band. One doesn’t need to look further than an SNL sketch to see the divide between its fans in regards to whether they have even been remotely good for two-thirds of the length of their careers. There’s a lot to be said about the evolution of the band, the directions it has taken from album to album, Cuomo’s evolution as a songwriter, with his ambition edging on musical genius levels and much more. What is clear is that what is most magical about this band is that despite its harshest critics, there still manages to be undeniable brilliance interwoven into their discography.

Despite how they look, they are bona fide rock stars. The dichotomy or illusion between how Weezer sounds and how they look has been something that has been talked about since they made it big. The classic comment of them being nerds comes to mind, but there are not any more nerds than the Red Hot Chili Peppers or the Foo Fighters. They are just four men hopelessly addicted to the music and making songs and sounds that resonate with the general populace. This distinguishes them from the rest. Sure, some of them wear glasses, but so did Buddy Holly.

I enjoy some of their more recent albums despite mixed reception. Pacific Daydream gave me a taste of what Weezer was capable of, and they flexed some of their muscles in ways many didn’t think they had it in them. They made catchy pop songs that were enviable of some of the most prolific pop songwriters that are out there. That is just one of the many reasons that they are so successful. They are all around music nerds; they go hunting for good sounds no matter the genre, and it was no coincidence that they were able to make a catchy hook without much effort.
